This is the installation instructions for NCSE, with the assumption that the NC package is installed.

1. Download the NCSE.zip.
2. Extract all files from NCSE.zip into the NC folder in which the NC package is installed. Overwrite init.m when prompted.

Note: The NCSE package is compatible with the 23Aug2018 version of NC. NCSE should be compatible with all NC versions which have the same init.m as the 23Aug2018 version of NC.

Updated 14/4/2020. 
1. NCSE now uses the Mathematica SPD by default. The Mathematica SDP requires Mathematica Version 12.0 or later to run. NCSDP may be used instead of Mathematica SDP as an option. 
2. Added several functions for computation of maximal 1-dilations and Arveson dilations for elements of a free spectrahedron.
3. Various bug fixes.
