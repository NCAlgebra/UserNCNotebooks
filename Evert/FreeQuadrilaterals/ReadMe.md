# The Arveson Boundary of a Free Quadrilateral is given by a Noncommutative Variety

* Author: Eric Evert
* Relevant Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13250
* Last updated date: 1 September 2020

* This folder contains three notebooks. The notebooks are: 
1. An NC Grobner basis computation using NCGBX.
2. A step by step NC Grobner basis done with NCAlgebra.
3. A notebook for computing free projective maps between free quadrilaterals as well as the NC polynomials which annihlate the Arveson boundary of a given free quadrilateral.

* The notebooks in this folder use the NCAlgebra package together with NCSE (found in the NCSpectrahedronExtreme subfolder of UserNCNotebooks)
